Reword is a community moderation tool that uses AI to help create a safer online environment. Built with Golang for efficient processing and leveraging the GPT-4 language model, the system is designed to automatically detect and rephrase inappropriate comments. By using LangChain to manage these tasks, Reword provides a safety layer that helps turn potentially harmful language into more civil messages, aiming to support a community's positive engagement.
